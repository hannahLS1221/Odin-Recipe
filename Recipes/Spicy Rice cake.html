    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tteokbokki (also spelled ddukbokki, ddeokbokki, dukbokki or topokki), 떡볶이, is a beloved Korean rice cake dish with many variations and a rich history. Literally translated as “stir-fried rice cake”, this dish is made with garaetteok, a cylinder-shaped white rice cake. This spicy rice cake dish is enormously popular as a street food and also often enjoyed at home.</h2>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound tteokbokki tteok 떡볶이 떡 (about 24 3-inch long rice cake pieces)</li>
        <li>1 sheet eomuk 어묵 (fish cake)</li>
        <li>4 ounces green cabbage</li>
        <li>1 - 2 scallions</li>
        <li>3 cups anchovy broth or water (use 4 cups for more sauce)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Korean red chili pepper paste (gochujang, 고추장)</li>
        <li>1 - 3 teaspoons Korean red chili pepper flakes (gochugaru, 고추가루) - preferably finely ground</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar (or use 1 tablespoon if you like it less sweet)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon corn syrup (or 1 more tablespoon sugar)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        
    
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Make anchovy broth (see note). Soak the rice cakes for about 20 minutes if hardened or refrigerated. Cut the fish cake, cabbage, and scallions into about 2-inch long pieces.</li>
        <li>Add the anchovy broth (or water) to a large pan. Stir in the sauce ingredients. Bring it to a boil over medium high heat, stirring to dissolve the red chili pepper paste (gochujang).</li>
        <li>Add the rice cakes. Boil until the rice cakes become very soft and the sauce is thickened, about 8 - 10 minutes. Stir frequently so the rice cakes don't stick to the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the vegetables and fish cakes. Continue to boil, stirring constantly, for an additional 4 - 6 minutes. Depending on rice cakes, you may need more time to reach a desired level of softness. Add more broth or water as necessary. Taste the sauce, and adjust the seasoning if needed. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
