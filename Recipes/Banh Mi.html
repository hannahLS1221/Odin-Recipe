    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"Banh Mi" is a sandwich made with grilled pork, chicken or pate and commonly served by street vendors in Vietnam.  The word Banh Mi literally means "bread" in Vietnamese; it refers to the French baguette bread that is used to make this Vietnamese sandwich.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 8-inch French baguettes</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 lbs boneless pork butt, cut into 1/4-inch thick slices.</li>
        <li>Vietnamese pickled carrots and daikon</li>
        <li>1 bunch of cilantro leaves</li>

    </ul>
    <ul><h4>Lemongrass Pork Marinade:</h4>
        <li>1/2 cup minced lemongrass</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>5 shallots, peeled and minced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sweet soy sauce</li>
    
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Lightly pound the pork slices with a mallet or the back of the kitchen knife. In a bowl, mix all the Marinade ingredients together. Marinate the pork with the Marinade, for 2 hours or best overnight. Discard excess marinade before grilling.</li>
        <li>Fire up the grill. Arrange the marinated pork onto the grill. Grill until the pork is nicely charred on both sides or until the pork is cooked through. If you are using a broiler oven, broil for 5-7 minutes on each side or until the pork is completely cooked and nicely charred.</li>
        <li>Remove the pork from the grill. Spread the the mayonnaise on the baguette and add a few grilled pork slices. Top the pork with pickled carrots and daikon and cilantro leaves. Cut the baguette into halves and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
